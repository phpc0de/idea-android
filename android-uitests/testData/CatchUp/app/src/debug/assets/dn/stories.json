So we positioned Pattern to be the easiest website builder for Etsy sellers possible. \r\n\r\n###During - Usability testings to identify flawed UX flows###\r\nWe worked closely with our in-house research department and conducted a few rounds of 1:1 usability testings to watch how sellers interact with early prototypes and later, live betas. \r\n\r\n###Close to launch - Marketing/communication-focused research###\r\nAs soon as the product feature is close to complete, we worked to make sure our marketing language to be spot-on.

I am digging the site! \r\nI have a few notes, but I will preface them by saying I love the site, but just went through a portfolio redesign myself and understand how valuable feedback is :)\r\n\r\n1. The images aren't retina ready, so on my macbook everything is blurry which takes away from the portfolio to me. If I scale down the browser it looks fine, but at fullscreen it becomes really distracting.\r\nAlso even when scaled down, your headshot image is always blurry.\r\n\r\n2. The H5 under you headshot is barely readable to me in fullscreen, because of the color. I would recommend #7c7c7c, or #6c6c6c. Both of those colors made it much more readable, but still gray.\r\n\r\n3. Add something to the images to make me want to click them.\r\nwhether thats a hover animation, or something as simple as wrapping them in \u003Ca\u003E tags. right now, i have no way to know that clicking does anything.\r\n\r\n4. Inside the case study windows, I would make the Nav background color white.\r\nleave the bottom border, increase the padding a bit (of the nav). \r\nand Add the image inside the window.\r\nI only say this because I don't think the window matches the style of your site that well. primarily because the gray nav wasn't used anywhere else on the site.\r\nAnd I would love to see an image within this window, because I had forgotten what I clicked.\r\n\r\n5. At the bottom, where you have dribbble work, I would make the images reach the edge of the text. It looks like the image container has a bigger left/right margin than the text that says \"More work\". \r\nSo match the grid up, i think it would look a bit better.\r\n\r\n6. Increase the padding between the \"more work\" section and the footer, just by a tad.\r\n\r\nAnyway! Love the site, the blending of the image at the top is great. \r\nKeep it up! hopefully this stuff helps!\r\n\r\n",
