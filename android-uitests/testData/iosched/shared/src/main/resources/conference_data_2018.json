Hennessy, a pioneer in computer architecture, joined Stanford’s faculty in 1977 as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. In 1981, he drew together researchers to focus on a technology known as RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer), which revolutionized computing by increasing performance while reducing costs. Hennessy helped transfer this technology to industry co-founding MIPS Computer Systems in 1984. His subsequent research focused on multiprocessor systems, including the DASH and FLASH projects, both of which pioneered concepts now used in industry. He was appointed as the inaugural Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1987. He has been chair of Computer Science (1994-1996), dean of the School of Engineering (1996-1999), and university provost (1999-2000) before being appointed as Stanford’s 10th president in 2000. As president he focused on increasing financial aid and on developing new initiatives in multidisciplinary research and teaching. He was the founding board chair of Atheros Communications, one of the early developers of WiFi technology, and has served on the board of Cisco and Alphabet (Google’s parent company). His honors include the 2012 Medal of Honor of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the ACM Turing Award (jointly with David Patterson), the 2001 Eckert-Mauchly Award of the Association for Computing Machinery; the 2001 Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award, and the 2004 NEC C&C Prize for lifetime achievement in computer science and engineering.

Her essays feature in numerous anthologies, including State of the American Mind: Sixteen Leading Critics on the New Anti-Intellectualism (Templeton, 2015) and The Digital Divide: Arguments For and Against Facebook, Google, Texting and the Age of Social Networking (Penguin, 2011). She is the recipient of numerous fellowships and awards, including Media Awards from the Work-Life Council of the Conference Board and the Massachusetts Psychological Association, and three Front Page Awards from the Women’s Press Club of New York. For a National Public Radio segment on the lack of labor protections offered to child newspaper carriers, she was a finalist for a Hillman Prize, one of journalism’s highest honors for social justice reporting.

Thomas Professor in Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He is the co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity (CPE), and an expert in contemporary forms of racial bias and discrimination, as well as the intersections of race and gender. Dr. Goff serves as one of four Principal Investigators for the CPE’s National Justice Database, the first national database on racial disparities in police stops and use of force. More recently, Dr. Goff led the CPE in becoming one of three Principal Investigators for the U.S. Department of Justice’s National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, which will contribute information to the National Justice Database. Dr. Goff conducts work exploring the ways in which racial prejudice is not a necessary precondition for racial discrimination. That is, despite the normative view of racial discrimination—that it stems from prejudiced explicit or implicit attitudes—his research demonstrates that situational factors facilitate racially unequal outcomes. Dr. Goff’s model of evidence-based approaches to justice has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Department of Justice, Russell Sage Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Open Society Institute- Baltimore, Atlantic Philanthropies, William T. Grant Foundation, the COPS Office, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the NAACP LDF, NIMH, SPSSI, the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation among others.

Zoe received her PhD from Purdue University and her PhD/ME/BE from Tsinghua University, Beijing. Either as a principal contributor or as a Technical Lead, Zoe had previously devoted her effort to the design and development of several renowned video call products, including Apple's FaceTime, Tango Video Call across Android and iOS platforms, and Google Glass Video Call. Zoe in fact started her first exploration on real-time video communications back to the summer of 2001, when she was doing her internship at Bell Labs working on error resilient live video streaming over a simulated wireless network platform. Zoe is now working diligently with her team in the earliest possible deployment of AV1 to the online video use cases including YouTube. Zoe is also fascinated by any innovative video technologies, including the use of machine learning to both video encoder optimization and new video compression algorithm design, in preparation for the next generational video codecs. Zoe has published nearly 40 peer reviewed international conference and journal papers, and filed over 50 patents in the field of video compression, processing, communications, analysis and understanding.","company":"Google","thumbnailUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eVhw3TzjOCB7YAJ6H01-aZEJnO61p3bYjUrntBRD7RFw5Zof8aXcB3phO-pvESUiq-8njxjGxCaK2QC6OC3A9hED","socialLinks":{"GitHub":"","Website":"","Twitter":"","LinkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoeliu/"}}}}
