This inspection looks at Android API calls that have been annotated with various support
annotations (such as RequiresPermission or UiThread) and flags any calls
that are not using the API correctly as specified by the annotations.
<br><br>
Examples of errors flagged by this inspection:
<ul>
  <li>Passing the wrong type of resource integer (such as R.string) to an API that
  expects a different type (such as R.dimen).</li>
  <li>Forgetting to invoke the overridden method (via super) in methods that require it</li>
  <li>Calling a method that requires a permission without having declared that permission in the manifest</li>
  <li>Passing a resource color reference to a method which expects an RGB integer value.</li>
</ul>
...and many more.
