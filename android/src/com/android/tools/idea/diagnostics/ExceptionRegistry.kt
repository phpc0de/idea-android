/**
 * The [ExceptionRegistry] can be notified of a collection of exceptions, and it can
 * return all of these, in descending frequency order.
 *
 * # Data Structure
 *
 * The basic representation of a single throwable is to decompose it into
 * its individual stack frames, and then each frame is represented by a
 * [StackFrame] instance. Instead of using a list to hold the children of
 * a stack frame, it's using "first child" and "next sibling" references
 * instead. This avoids having to guess the number of anticipated children
 * up front when constructing array lists, or having to resize them later
 * if the guess is wrong.
 *
 * In many scenarios, particularly when something is really broken, the same
 * exception will be thrown over and over again. The [StackFrame] also has a count
 * field. This allows us to efficiently represent multiple registrations
 * of the same throwable; we match up the stack frames one by one and
 * increment their counts. This way 10,000 instances of a given throwable
 * takes the same amount of storage as a single one.
 *
 * As a small optimization, since it's quite common for there to only be
 * a single exception, this is special cased: when the first throwable comes
 * in, we simply store the full [Throwable] instance. If somebody queries
 * the top throwables at this point, we just return it. We don't actually
 * create a full tree of the individual frames. If a second throwable comes
 * in on the other hand, at that point we go and first create the tree
 * for the original throwable, and then process the new one.
 *
 * # Retrieving Exceptions
 *
 * In the above data structure, the leaf nodes uniquely identify a reported
 * exception; we can iterate back through the parent references to get the
 * exact chain of stack frames that was originally stored.
 *
 * To get the sorted exceptions, we simply gather the leaf nodes, then
 * sort them by frequency, and then we can retrieve the full stack frames
 * for each by repeatedly iterating up to the root.
 *
 * # Hashes
 *
 * The [ExceptionRegistry] is intended to be used for crash reporting, and
 * we don't currently have a simple way to report the crashes along with
 * frame frequencies. Therefore, we're planning on using fingerprints
 * for each stack frame, and then sending a simple sorted report which
 * lists the various fingerprints and their frequencies. We can then correlate
 * these on the server for the most common exceptions.
