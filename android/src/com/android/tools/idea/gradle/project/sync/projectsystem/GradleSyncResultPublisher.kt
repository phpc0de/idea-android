 * because no AndroidProjectSystem structs are initialized until one of the project system APIs is used. We want to make
 * sure that sync results are broadcast on [PROJECT_SYSTEM_SYNC_TOPIC] and the latest sync result is recorded
 * regardless of whether or not a project system method has been called.
