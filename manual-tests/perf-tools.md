# Performance Tools Manual Tests (Using the QA App)

* These tests require a connected device.
* In order for your own experience to most closely match the screenshots used
throughout this document, it is recommended you use a quad core Android device.
* Sections marked **bold** below indicate *test expectations*.

[TOC]

## Launching the Application

If you have access to Android Studio source code (via `repo sync`), the most
reliable way to open the latest version of the project is to find it at
`$SRC/tools/base/profiler/integration-tests/ProfilerTester`.

Otherwise, try downloading it at
[res/perf-tools/ProfilerTester.zip](res/perf-tools/ProfilerTester.zip)

Once the project is opened:

1. Follow any prompts to install any missing dependencies (SDK, NDK, etc.)
1. Make sure that the current Run Configuration for "app" has
   "Advance Profiling" enabled.
   * `Run > Edit Configurations > app > Profiling tab > Enable Advanced Profiling`
1. Launch the app on a device with API >= 21 (i.e. Lollipop or newer)
1. Profiler behavior changes in O. Please test all scenarios twice,
   once with a pre-O (API <= 25) device and again with an O or newer (API > 25) device.
1. Select the "Android Profiler" tool window in Android Studio.
   * Alternately: `Tools > Android > Android Profiler`

## Scenarios

The app presents two pulldowns.

![Profiler QA app screenshot][app]

You use the first pulldown to chose a category (CPU, Memory, Network, Events,
etc.) and the second pulldown to prepare a particular scenario (Perodic Usage,
File Writing, etc.)

Once any scenario is selected, press the "run" button to test it. The scenario
will run for some amount of time (anywhere from a few seconds to a minute)
before stopping, at which point you can observe and confirm its effects.

For convenience, you can also press the "previous" and "next" buttons to
navigate through all scenarios in the order presented in this document.

## Profilers

By default, the "Android Profilers" toolbar presents a top-level view of all
profilers. From that view, you can click on any of the graphs to jump into a
more detailed view for that profiler. (*Note that Event profiling is an
exception, as it is always shown above all profilers*).

**Therefore, when running a scenario for a particular area, e.g. CPU, be sure
to open up that profiler in Android Studio to observe the scenario's detailed
effects.**

## CPU

### Periodic Usage

1. In the "Android Profiler" Toolbar, make sure you are on the CPU profiler.
1. In the QA App, select the "Periodic Usage" scenario.
1. Press the "run" button
1. You should see **CPU usage increase to around 70% for 2 seconds every 4
   seconds**
1. Look at the threads table and make sure you can see **three threads
   ("CpuAsyncTask #1", "CpuAsyncTask #2", "CpuAsyncTask #3")**
1. **Each thread should be responsible for its own CPU usage spikes.**
5. **Each thread should run for 2 seconds (green), sleep for 4 seconds (grey),
   and then close**.

![CPU - Periodic Usage][cpu-periodic]

### File Writing

1. In the "Android Profiler" Toolbar, make sure you are on the CPU profiler.
1. In the QA App, select the "File Writing" scenario.
1. Press the "run" button
1. You should see **four threads perform "writing" with running (green) and
   waiting state (light green)**
1. Wait 2 seconds after all writing threads stop running.
1. You should see **four threads reading the file.**

![CPU - File Writing][cpu-file-write]

### Native Code

**(This test is expected to work only on Android O+, API >= 26)**

1. In the "Android Profiler" Toolbar, make sure you are on the CPU profiler.

1. In the CPU profiler, make sure the selected configuration is set to
   "Sampled (Native)" and press "Record"
1. In the QA App, press the "run" button.
1. After about five seconds, you should get a toast, showing the message
   "Finished calling native code"
1. In the CPU profiler, press "Stop" to finish the recording.
1. In the "THREADS" view, scroll down and select the thread with a name which
   will be something like "AsyncTask #3" or "AsyncTask #4" (the exact number may
   be different).
   * You'll know you found the right thread when you see a longer, solid, dark
     bar.
   because there should be a long, solid bar representing activity.
1. **In the "Call Chart" view, you should see both blue (system) and
   green (user) function calls.**
   * You can zoom in on the area and confirm that the green function call is
     called "DoExpensiveFpuCalculation".
   * *Optional:* You can also type "Fpu" into the method filter to highlight the
     native methods.

### Startup Profiling

**(This test is expected to work only on Android O+, API >= 26)**

1. Edit the run configuration for "app", going to the "Profiling" tab.
1. Check the "Start recording a method trace on startup" option
   * Feel free to leave the particular trace config on "Sampled (Java)", but if
     you change it, just remember your choice for later.
1. Press "OK" and return to the main editor view.
1. Restart your profiling session by hitting the "profile" button.
1. In the "Androd Profiler" toolbar, you should observe it automatically open
   into the CPU profiler. A recording should already be in progress.
1. Stop the recording.
1. Look at the "Call Chart" view below.
1. **Verify you see "ZygoteInit.main" and "ActivityThread.main" in the list of
   methods.**
   * This confirms the profiler started recording before the first activity
     opened.
1. **Don't forget**: Go back into the run configuration for "app" and uncheck
   the "Start recording..." option.

   will be something like "AsyncTask #3" or "AsyncTask #4" (the exact number may
   be different).
   * You'll know you found the right thread when you see a longer, solid, grey
     bar. (It's grey because it makes calls to other threads and sleeps, waiting
     for them)
1. **In the "Trace Events" view, you should see a single dark green bar labelled
   "CodeWithTraceMarkersTask#execute"**
