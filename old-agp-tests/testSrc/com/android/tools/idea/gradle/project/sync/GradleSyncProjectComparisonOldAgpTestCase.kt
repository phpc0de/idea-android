/**
 * Snapshot tests for 'Gradle Sync' that use old versions of AGP
 *
 * These tests compare the results of sync by converting the resulting project to a stable text format which does not depend on local
 * environment (and ideally should not depend on the versions of irrelevant libraries) and comparing them to pre-recorded golden sync
 * results.
 *
 * The pre-recorded sync results can be found in testData/syncedProjectSnapshots/ *.txt files. Consult [snapshotSuffixes] for more
 * details on the way in which the file names are constructed.
 *
 * NOTE: It you made changes to sync or the test projects which make these tests fail in an expected way, you can re-run the tests
 *       from IDE with -DUPDATE_TEST_SNAPSHOTS to update the files. (You may need to re-run several times (currently up to 3) to
 *       update multiple snapshots used in one test.
 *
 *       Or with bazel:
bazel test //tools/adt/idea/old-agp-tests:intellij.android.old-agp-tests_tests \
--jvmopt="-DUPDATE_TEST_SNAPSHOTS=$(bazel info workspace)" --test_output=streamed
