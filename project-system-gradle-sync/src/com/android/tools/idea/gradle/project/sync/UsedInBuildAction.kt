/**
 * Marks a given CLASS or FUNCTION to indicate that it is used in a Gradle tooling API BuildAction.
 * This means that extra care should be taken when adding dependencies or changing the code. Calls to methods in this
 * code may only be valid when running with specific versions of Gradle or the Android Gradle Plugin.
 *
 * Also no references should be held to any objects from the Gradle tooling API. This API returns proxy objects from Gradle which can
 * cause memory leaks if kept around in the IDE.
 *
 * Classes marked with this annotation must also implement [java.io.Serializable] along with all their non-primitive members.
 * This is so that they can be passed to the Gradle process using Gradle's serialization methods.
