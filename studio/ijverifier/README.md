This directory contains tests which run the
[IntelliJ Plugin Verifier](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugin-verifier).

The plugin verifier checks the binary compatibility between an IntelliJ plugin
and a specific version of the IntelliJ Platform. It can also check for usages
of deprecated and experimental APIs.
